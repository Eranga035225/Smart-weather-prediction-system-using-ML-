# 🌦️ Smart Weather Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project aims to build an intelligent weather prediction system using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical weather data to forecast parameters like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.





# 🌐 Overview
This system uses machine learning techniques to analyze past weather data and predict upcoming weather conditions. It is especially helpful for:
- Students learning ML
- Weather-based decision-making systems
- Early alert applications

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Predicts weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind, etc.
- 📊 Visualizes predictions and historical data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 📈 Implements ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- 🧪 Train/test split, evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, etc.)
- 🧠 Ready to expand with deep learning or LSTM
- 💾 CSV-based dataset support
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook based interface
- 📦 Containerization support (via Dockerfile)
