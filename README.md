# 🐋 How to Run the Smart Weather Prediction System Using Docker

This guide lets you run your Smart Weather Prediction System project inside a Docker container using a Jupyter Notebook environment.

---

## ✅ 1. Prerequisites

- **Install Docker Desktop**:\
  [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- Verify installation:

  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

---

## 📁 2. Ensure the Following Project Structure

```
Smart-weather-prediction-system-using-ML/
├── data/                    # CSV files
├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile              # Docker build config (create this)
```

---

## 🧱 3. Create a Dockerfile

In the project root, create a file named `Dockerfile` and paste:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install -r requirements.txt && \
    pip install notebook jupyter

EXPOSE 8888

CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]
```

---

## 📦 4. Build the Docker Image

From the project root:

```bash
docker build -t smart-weather-predictor .
```

---

## ▶️ 5. Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 smart-weather-predictor
```

You will see a terminal output with a URL like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=your_token_here
```

Copy this URL and paste it into your browser.

---

## 📅 6. Open and Run the Notebook

In Jupyter UI:

- Navigate to: `notebooks/01_lightgbm_model.ipynb`
- Run the notebook cells to execute the model.

---

## ♻️ Rebuild if Code Changes

If you change any dependencies or major code:

```bash
docker build -t smart-weather-predictor .
```

---

Happy Predicting! ☕️
